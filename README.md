goip
====

Had the domain name  [goip.org](http://goip.org) and figured it made the most sense to use it to return a public IP using [Go](http://golang.org/), even though it's not really necessary.

Usage

In browser
----------
`GET http://goip.org`

JSON
----
`GET -H "Accept: application/json" http://goip.org`

or

`GET http://goip.org/api`
